You need to first have potatoes,cut the potatoes and then keep them in a pan. if you want the curry to have liquid you can add water if not no need.
Then add masalas to the potatoes,keep them in high flame or low flame or medium flame.After sometime add salt.Then mix the potatoes with all the masala's properly,and your potato curry is over.
